## 📜 Abstract
Real-time gesture recognition systems often suffer from latency due to the classification of completed motions. **ZeroLag RPS** is a model designed to defeat a human opponent in Rock-Paper-Scissors by predicting moves *before* gesture completion.

We developed a hybrid architecture combining a **ResNet-18 spatial encoder** with a **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) head**, trained on a custom dataset of gesture sequences. The TCN's dilated causal convolutions efficiently model temporal dependencies within a 64-frame window, enabling the detection of subtle "wind-up" micromovements. Deployed in a live environment, the system delivers zero-latency counter-moves for a seamless user experience.
## 🎥 Demo

*The system predicts "Scissors" (and plays "Rock") while the hand is still in the wind-up phase.*

## 🧠 Model Architecture

Our approach solves the **"Rock Paradox"** (where all moves start looking like Rock) using a specialized pipeline:

1.  **Spatial Focus:** **MediaPipe Hands** extracts skeletal crops to ensure translation invariance and remove background noise.
2.  **Feature Extraction:** A **ResNet-18** encoder converts frames into feature vectors.
3.  **Temporal Modeling:** A **TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)** processes a rolling buffer of 64 frames. We chose TCNs over LSTMs to enable parallelization and precise receptive field engineering.
4.  **Optimization:** Trained using a **Sigmoid Time-Weighted Loss** to penalize early-game ambiguity less than late-game precision.
